								<h1 id="hocon-human-optimized-config-object-notation-">HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation)</h1>
<p>This is an informal spec, but hopefully it&#39;s clear.</p>
<h2 id="goals-background">Goals / Background</h2>
<p>The primary goal is: keep the semantics (tree structure; set of
types; encoding/escaping) from JSON, but make it more convenient
as a human-editable config file format.</p>
<p>The following features are desirable, to support human usage:</p>
<ul>
<li>less noisy / less pedantic syntax</li>
<li>ability to refer to another part of the configuration (set a value to
another value)</li>
<li>import/include another configuration file into the current file</li>
<li>a mapping to a flat properties list such as Java&#39;s system properties</li>
<li>ability to get values from environment variables</li>
<li>ability to write comments</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementation-wise, the format should have these properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>a JSON superset, that is, all valid JSON should be valid and
should result in the same in-memory data that a JSON parser
would have produced.</li>
<li>be deterministic; the format is flexible, but it is not
heuristic. It should be clear what&#39;s invalid and invalid files
should generate errors.</li>
<li>require minimal look-ahead; should be able to tokenize the file
by looking at only the next three characters. (right now, the
only reason to look at three is to find &quot;//&quot; comments;
otherwise you can parse looking at two.)</li>
</ul>
<p>HOCON is significantly harder to specify and to parse than
JSON. Think of it as moving the work from the person maintaining
the config file to the computer program.</p>
<h2 id="definitions">Definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>a <em>key</em> is a string JSON would have to the left of <code>:</code> and a <em>value</em> is
anything JSON would have to the right of <code>:</code>. i.e. the two
halves of an object <em>field</em>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>a <em>value</em> is any &quot;value&quot; as defined in the JSON spec, plus
unquoted strings and substitutions as defined in this spec.</p>
</li>
<li><p>a <em>simple value</em> is any value excluding an object or array
value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>a <em>field</em> is a key, any separator such as &#39;:&#39;, and a value.</p>
</li>
<li><p>references to a <em>file</em> (&quot;the file being parsed&quot;) can be
understood to mean any byte stream being parsed, not just
literal files in a filesystem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<p>Much of this is defined with reference to JSON; you can find the
JSON spec at <a href="http://json.org/">http://json.org/</a> of course.</p>
<h3 id="unchanged-from-json">Unchanged from JSON</h3>
<ul>
<li>files must be valid UTF-8</li>
<li>quoted strings are in the same format as JSON strings</li>
<li>values have possible types: string, number, object, array, boolean, null</li>
<li>allowed number formats matches JSON; as in JSON, some possible
floating-point values are not represented, such as <code>NaN</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>Anything between <code>//</code> or <code>#</code> and the next newline is considered a comment
and ignored, unless the <code>//</code> or <code>#</code> is inside a quoted string.</p>
<h3 id="omit-root-braces">Omit root braces</h3>
<p>JSON documents must have an array or object at the root. Empty
files are invalid documents, as are files containing only a
non-array non-object value such as a string.</p>
<p>In HOCON, if the file does not begin with a square bracket or
curly brace, it is parsed as if it were enclosed with <code>{}</code> curly
braces.</p>
<p>A HOCON file is invalid if it omits the opening <code>{</code> but still has
a closing <code>}</code>; the curly braces must be balanced.</p>
<h3 id="key-value-separator">Key-value separator</h3>
<p>The <code>=</code> character can be used anywhere JSON allows <code>:</code>, i.e. to
separate keys from values.</p>
<p>If a key is followed by <code>{</code>, the <code>:</code> or <code>=</code> may be omitted. So
<code>&quot;foo&quot; {}</code> means <code>&quot;foo&quot; : {}</code></p>
<h3 id="commas">Commas</h3>
<p>Values in arrays, and fields in objects, need not have a comma
between them as long as they have at least one ASCII newline
(<code>\n</code>, decimal value 10) between them.</p>
<p>The last element in an array or last field in an object may be
followed by a single comma. This extra comma is ignored.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[1,2,3,]</code> and <code>[1,2,3]</code> are the same array.</li>
<li><code>[1\n2\n3]</code> and <code>[1,2,3]</code> are the same array.</li>
<li><code>[1,2,3,,]</code> is invalid because it has two trailing commas.</li>
<li><code>[,1,2,3]</code> is invalid because it has an initial comma.</li>
<li><code>[1,,2,3]</code> is invalid because it has two commas in a row.</li>
<li>these same comma rules apply to fields in objects.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h3>
<p>The JSON spec simply says &quot;whitespace&quot;; in HOCON whitespace is
defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>any Unicode space separator (Zs category), line separator (Zl
category), or paragraph separator (Zp category), including
nonbreaking spaces (such as 0x00A0, 0x2007, and 0x202F).
The BOM (0xFEFF) must also be treated as whitespace.</li>
<li>tab (<code>\t</code> 0x0009), newline (&#39;\n&#39; 0x000A), vertical tab (&#39;\v&#39;
0x000B)<code>, form feed (</code>\f&#39; 0x000C), carriage return (&#39;\r&#39;
0x000D), file separator (0x001C), group separator (0x001D),
record separator (0x001E), unit separator (0x001F).</li>
</ul>
<p>In Java, the <code>isWhitespace()</code> method covers these characters with
the exception of nonbreaking spaces and the BOM.</p>
<p>While all Unicode separators should be treated as whitespace, in
this spec &quot;newline&quot; refers only and specifically to ASCII newline
0x000A.</p>
<h3 id="duplicate-keys-and-object-merging">Duplicate keys and object merging</h3>
<p>The JSON spec does not clarify how duplicate keys in the same
object should be handled. In HOCON, duplicate keys that appear
later override those that appear earlier, unless both values are
objects. If both values are objects, then the objects are merged.</p>
<p>Note: this would make HOCON a non-superset of JSON if you assume
that JSON requires duplicate keys to have a behavior. The
assumption here is that duplicate keys are invalid JSON.</p>
<p>To merge objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>add fields present in only one of the two objects to the merged
object.</li>
<li>for non-object-valued fields present in both objects,
the field found in the second object must be used.</li>
<li>for object-valued fields present in both objects, the
object values should be recursively merged according to
these same rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Object merge can be prevented by setting the key to another value
first. This is because merging is always done two values at a
time; if you set a key to an object, a non-object, then an object,
first the non-object falls back to the object (non-object always
wins), and then the object falls back to the non-object (no
merging, object is the new value). So the two objects never see
each other.</p>
<p>These two are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>" : <span class="hljs-value">{ "<span class="hljs-attribute">a</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">42</span> </span>}</span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>" : <span class="hljs-value">{ "<span class="hljs-attribute">b</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">43</span> </span>}
</span>}

{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>" : <span class="hljs-value">{ "<span class="hljs-attribute">a</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">42</span></span>, "<span class="hljs-attribute">b</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">43</span> </span>}
</span>}
</code></pre><p>And these two are equivalent:</p>
<pre><code>{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>" : <span class="hljs-value">{ "<span class="hljs-attribute">a</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">42</span> </span>}</span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-literal">null</span></span>,
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>" : <span class="hljs-value">{ "<span class="hljs-attribute">b</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">43</span> </span>}
</span>}

{
    "<span class="hljs-attribute">foo</span>" : <span class="hljs-value">{ "<span class="hljs-attribute">b</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">43</span> </span>}
</span>}
</code></pre><p>The intermediate setting of <code>&quot;foo&quot;</code> to <code>null</code> prevents the object merge.</p>
<h3 id="unquoted-strings">Unquoted strings</h3>
<p>A sequence of characters outside of a quoted string is a string
value if:</p>
<ul>
<li>it does not contain &quot;forbidden characters&quot;: &#39;$&#39;, &#39;&quot;&#39;, &#39;{&#39;, &#39;}&#39;,
&#39;[&#39;, &#39;]&#39;, &#39;:&#39;, &#39;=&#39;, &#39;,&#39;, &#39;+&#39;, &#39;#&#39;, &#39;`&#39;, &#39;^&#39;, &#39;?&#39;, &#39;!&#39;, &#39;@&#39;,
&#39;*&#39;, &#39;&amp;&#39;, &#39;\&#39; (backslash), or whitespace.</li>
<li>it does not contain the two-character string &quot;//&quot; (which
starts a comment)</li>
<li>its initial characters do not parse as <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, <code>null</code>,
or a number.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unquoted strings are used literally, they do not support any kind
of escaping. Quoted strings may always be used as an alternative
when you need to write a character that is not permitted in an
unquoted string.</p>
<p><code>truefoo</code> parses as the boolean token <code>true</code> followed by the
unquoted string <code>foo</code>. However, <code>footrue</code> parses as the unquoted
string <code>footrue</code>. Similarly, <code>10.0bar</code> is the number <code>10.0</code> then
the unquoted string <code>bar</code> but <code>bar10.0</code> is the unquoted string
<code>bar10.0</code>. (In practice, this distinction doesn&#39;t matter much
because of value concatenation; see later section.)</p>
<p>In general, once an unquoted string begins, it continues until a
forbidden character or the two-character string &quot;//&quot; is
encountered. Embedded (non-initial) booleans, nulls, and numbers
are not recognized as such, they are part of the string.</p>
<p>An unquoted string may not <em>begin</em> with the digits 0-9 or with a
hyphen (<code>-</code>, 0x002D) because those are valid characters to begin a
JSON number. The initial number character, plus any valid-in-JSON
number characters that follow it, must be parsed as a number
value. Again, these characters are not special <em>inside</em> an
unquoted string; they only trigger number parsing if they appear
initially.</p>
<p>Note that quoted JSON strings may not contain control characters
(control characters include some whitespace characters, such as
newline). This rule is from the JSON spec. However, unquoted
strings have no restriction on control characters, other than the
ones listed as &quot;forbidden characters&quot; above.</p>
<p>Some of the &quot;forbidden characters&quot; are forbidden because they
already have meaning in JSON or HOCON, others are essentially
reserved keywords to allow future extensions to this spec.</p>
<h3 id="multi-line-strings">Multi-line strings</h3>
<p>Multi-line strings are similar to Python or Scala, using triple
quotes. If the three-character sequence <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> appears, then all
Unicode characters until a closing <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> sequence are used
unmodified to create a string value. Newlines and whitespace
receive no special treatment. Unlike Scala, and unlike JSON quoted
strings, Unicode escapes are not interpreted in triple-quoted
strings.</p>
<p>In Python, <code>&quot;&quot;&quot;foo&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</code> is a syntax error (a triple-quoted string
followed by a dangling unbalanced quote). In Scala, it is a
four-character string <code>foo&quot;</code>. HOCON works like Scala; any sequence
of at least three quotes ends the multi-line string, and any
&quot;extra&quot; quotes are part of the string.</p>
<h3 id="value-concatenation">Value concatenation</h3>
<p>The value of an object field or array element may consist of
multiple values which are combined. There are three kinds of value
concatenation:</p>
<ul>
<li>if all the values are simple values (neither objects nor
arrays), they are concatenated into a string.</li>
<li>if all the values are arrays, they are concatenated into
one array.</li>
<li>if all the values are objects, they are merged (as with
duplicate keys) into one object.</li>
</ul>
<p>String value concatenation is allowed in field keys, in addition
to field values and array elements. Objects and arrays do not make
sense as field keys.</p>
<p>Note: Akka 2.0 (and thus Play 2.0) contains an embedded
implementation of the config lib which does not support array and
object value concatenation; it only supports string value
concatenation.</p>
<h4 id="string-value-concatenation">String value concatenation</h4>
<p>String value concatenation is the trick that makes unquoted
strings work; it also supports substitutions (<code>${foo}</code> syntax) in
strings.</p>
<p>Only simple values participate in string value
concatenation. Recall that a simple value is any value other than
arrays and objects.</p>
<p>As long as simple values are separated only by non-newline
whitespace, the <em>whitespace between them is preserved</em> and the
values, along with the whitespace, are concatenated into a string.</p>
<p>String value concatenations never span a newline, or a character
that is not part of a simple value.</p>
<p>A string value concatenation may appear in any place that a string
may appear, including object keys, object values, and array
elements.</p>
<p>Whenever a value would appear in JSON, a HOCON parser instead
collects multiple values (including the whitespace between them)
and concatenates those values into a string.</p>
<p>Whitespace before the first and after the last simple value must
be discarded. Only whitespace <em>between</em> simple values must be
preserved.</p>
<p>So for example <code>foo bar baz</code> parses as three unquoted strings,
and the three are value-concatenated into one string. The inner
whitespace is kept and the leading and trailing whitespace is
trimmed. The equivalent string, written in quoted form, would be
<code>&quot;foo bar baz&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Value concatenating <code>foo bar</code> (two unquoted strings with
whitespace) and quoted string <code>&quot;foo bar&quot;</code> would result in the same
in-memory representation, seven characters.</p>
<p>For purposes of string value concatenation, non-string values are
converted to strings as follows (strings shown as quoted strings):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true</code> and <code>false</code> become the strings <code>&quot;true&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;false&quot;</code>.</li>
<li><code>null</code> becomes the string <code>&quot;null&quot;</code>.</li>
<li>quoted and unquoted strings are themselves.</li>
<li>numbers should be kept as they were originally written in the
file. For example, if you parse <code>1e5</code> then you might render
it alternatively as <code>1E5</code> with capital <code>E</code>, or just <code>100000</code>.
For purposes of value concatenation, it should be rendered
as it was written in the file.</li>
<li>a substitution is replaced with its value which is then
converted to a string as above.</li>
<li>it is invalid for arrays or objects to appear in a string value
concatenation.</li>
</ul>
<p>A single value is never converted to a string. That is, it would
be wrong to value concatenate <code>true</code> by itself; that should be
parsed as a boolean-typed value. Only <code>true foo</code> (<code>true</code> with
another simple value on the same line) should be parsed as a value
concatenation and converted to a string.</p>
<h4 id="array-and-object-concatenation">Array and object concatenation</h4>
<p>Arrays can be concatenated with arrays, and objects with objects,
but it is an error if they are mixed.</p>
<p>For purposes of concatenation, &quot;array&quot; also means &quot;substitution
that resolves to an array&quot; and &quot;object&quot; also means &quot;substitution
that resolves to an object.&quot;</p>
<p>Within an field value or array element, if only non-newline
whitespace separates the end of a first array or object or
substitution from the start of a second array or object or
substitution, the two values are concatenated. Newlines may occur
<em>within</em> the array or object, but not <em>between</em> them. Newlines
<em>between</em> prevent concatenation.</p>
<p>For objects, &quot;concatenation&quot; means &quot;merging&quot;, so the second object
overrides the first.</p>
<p>Arrays and objects cannot be field keys, whether concatenation is
involved or not.</p>
<p>Here are several ways to define <code>a</code> to the same object value:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">// one object</span>
a : { b : <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> : <span class="hljs-number">2</span> }
<span class="hljs-comment">// two objects that are merged via concatenation rules</span>
a : { b : <span class="hljs-number">1</span> } { <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> : <span class="hljs-number">2</span> }
<span class="hljs-comment">// two fields that are merged</span>
a : { b : <span class="hljs-number">1</span> }
a : { <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> : <span class="hljs-number">2</span> }
</code></pre><p>Here are several ways to define <code>a</code> to the same array value:</p>
<pre><code>// <span class="hljs-constant">one</span> array
<span class="hljs-operator">a</span> : [ <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span> ]<span class="hljs-comment">
// two arrays that are concatenated</span>
<span class="hljs-operator">a</span> : [ <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span> ] [ <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span> ]<span class="hljs-comment">
// a later definition referring to an earlier</span><span class="hljs-comment">
// (see "self-referential substitutions" below)</span>
<span class="hljs-operator">a</span> : [ <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span> ]
<span class="hljs-operator">a</span> : ${<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>} [ <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span> ]

<h3 id="path-expressions">Path expressions</h3>
<p>Path expressions are used to write out a path through the object
graph. They appear in two places; in substitutions, like
<code>${foo.bar}</code>, and as the keys in objects like <code>{ foo.bar : 42 }</code>.</p>
<p>Path expressions are syntactically identical to a value
concatenation, except that they may not contain
substitutions. This means that you can&#39;t nest substitutions inside
other substitutions, and you can&#39;t have substitutions in keys.</p>
<p>When concatenating the path expression, any <code>.</code> characters outside
quoted strings are understood as path separators, while inside
quoted strings <code>.</code> has no special meaning. So
<code>foo.bar.&quot;hello.world&quot;</code> would be a path with three elements,
looking up key <code>foo</code>, key <code>bar</code>, then key <code>hello.world</code>.</p>
<p>The main tricky point is that <code>.</code> characters in numbers do count
as a path separator. When dealing with a number as part of a path
expression, it&#39;s essential to retain the <em>original</em> string
representation of the number as it appeared in the file (rather
than converting it back to a string with a generic
number-to-string library function).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>10.0foo</code> is a number then unquoted string <code>foo</code> and should
be the two-element path with <code>10</code> and <code>0foo</code> as the elements.</li>
<li><code>foo10.0</code> is an unquoted string with a <code>.</code> in it, so this would
be a two-element path with <code>foo10</code> and <code>0</code> as the elements.</li>
<li><code>foo&quot;10.0&quot;</code> is an unquoted then a quoted string which are
concatenated, so this is a single-element path.</li>
<li><code>1.2.3</code> is the three-element path with <code>1</code>,<code>2</code>,<code>3</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike value concatenations, path expressions are <em>always</em>
converted to a string, even if they are just a single value.</p>
<p>If you have an array or element value consisting of the single
value <code>true</code>, it&#39;s a value concatenation and retains its character
as a boolean value.</p>
<p>If you have a path expression (in a key or substitution) then it
must always be converted to a string, so <code>true</code> becomes the string
that would be quoted as <code>&quot;true&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>If a path element is an empty string, it must always be quoted.
That is, <code>a.&quot;&quot;.b</code> is a valid path with three elements, and the
middle element is an empty string. But <code>a..b</code> is invalid and
should generate an error. Following the same rule, a path that
starts or ends with a <code>.</code> is invalid and should generate an error.</p>
<h3 id="paths-as-keys">Paths as keys</h3>
<p>If a key is a path expression with multiple elements, it is
expanded to create an object for each path element other than the
last. The last path element, combined with the value, becomes a
field in the most-nested object.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-filename">foo.bar </span>: <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre><p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">foo</span> <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">bar </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">42</span> </span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>and:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-filename">foo.bar.baz </span>: <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre><p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">foo</span> { <span class="hljs-title">bar</span> { <span class="hljs-title">baz</span> : <span class="hljs-number">42</span> } }
</code></pre><p>and so on. These values are merged in the usual way; which implies
that:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-operator">a</span>.x : <span class="hljs-number">42</span>, <span class="hljs-operator">a</span>.y : <span class="hljs-number">43</span>
</code></pre><p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">a</span> <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">x </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">42</span>, y : <span class="hljs-number">43</span> </span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>Because path expressions work like value concatenations, you can
have whitespace in keys:</p>
<pre><code>a b <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> : <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre><p>is equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-string">"a b c"</span> : <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre><p>Because path expressions are always converted to strings, even
single values that would normally have another type become
strings.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>true : 42</code> is <code>&quot;true&quot; : 42</code></li>
<li><code>3 : 42</code> is <code>&quot;3&quot; : 42</code></li>
<li><code>3.14 : 42</code> is <code>&quot;3&quot; : { &quot;14&quot; : 42 }</code></li>
</ul>
<p>As a special rule, the unquoted string <code>include</code> may not begin a
path expression in a key, because it has a special interpretation
(see below).</p>
<h3 id="substitutions">Substitutions</h3>
<p>Substitutions are a way of referring to other parts of the
configuration tree.</p>
<p>The syntax is <code>${pathexpression}</code> or <code>${?pathexpression}</code> where
the <code>pathexpression</code> is a path expression as described above. This
path expression has the same syntax that you could use for an
object key.</p>
<p>The <code>?</code> in <code>${?pathexpression}</code> must not have whitespace before
it; the three characters <code>${?</code> must be exactly like that, grouped
together.</p>
<p>For substitutions which are not found in the configuration tree,
implementations may try to resolve them by looking at system
environment variables or other external sources of configuration.
(More detail on environment variables in a later section.)</p>
<p>Substitutions are not parsed inside quoted strings. To get a
string containing a substitution, you must use value concatenation
with the substitution in the unquoted portion:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">key</span> : <span class="hljs-variable">${animal.favorite}</span> is my favorite animal
</code></pre><p>Or you could quote the non-substitution portion:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">key</span> : <span class="hljs-variable">${animal.favorite}</span><span class="hljs-string">" is my favorite animal"</span>
</code></pre><p>Substitutions are resolved by looking up the path in the
configuration. The path begins with the root configuration object,
i.e. it is &quot;absolute&quot; rather than &quot;relative.&quot;</p>
<p>Substitution processing is performed as the last parsing step, so
a substitution can look forward in the configuration. If a
configuration consists of multiple files, it may even end up
retrieving a value from another file.</p>
<p>If a key has been specified more than once, the substitution will
always evaluate to its latest-assigned value (that is, it will
evaluate to the merged object, or the last non-object value that
was set, in the entire document being parsed including all
included files).</p>
<p>If a configuration sets a value to <code>null</code> then it should not be
looked up in the external source. Unfortunately there is no way to
&quot;undo&quot; this in a later configuration file; if you have <code>{ &quot;HOME&quot; :
null }</code> in a root object, then <code>${HOME}</code> will never look at the
environment variable. There is no equivalent to JavaScript&#39;s
<code>delete</code> operation in other words.</p>
<p>If a substitution does not match any value present in the
configuration and is not resolved by an external source, then it
is undefined. An undefined substitution with the <code>${foo}</code> syntax
is invalid and should generate an error.</p>
<p>If a substitution with the <code>${?foo}</code> syntax is undefined:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it is the value of an object field then the field should not
be created. If the field would have overridden a previously-set
value for the same field, then the previous value remains.</li>
<li>if it is an array element then the element should not be added.</li>
<li>if it is part of a value concatenation with another string then
it should become an empty string; if part of a value
concatenation with an object or array it should become an empty
object or array.</li>
<li><code>foo : ${?bar}</code> would avoid creating field <code>foo</code> if <code>bar</code> is
undefined. <code>foo : ${?bar}${?baz}</code> would also avoid creating the
field if <em>both</em> <code>bar</code> and <code>baz</code> are undefined.</li>
</ul>
<p>Substitutions are only allowed in field values and array
elements (value concatenations), they are not allowed in keys or
nested inside other substitutions (path expressions).</p>
<p>A substitution is replaced with any value type (number, object,
string, array, true, false, null). If the substitution is the only
part of a value, then the type is preserved. Otherwise, it is
value-concatenated to form a string.</p>
<h4 id="self-referential-substitutions">Self-Referential Substitutions</h4>
<p>The big picture:</p>
<ul>
<li>substitutions normally &quot;look forward&quot; and use the final value
for their path expression</li>
<li>when this would create a cycle, when possible the cycle must be
broken by looking backward only (thus removing one of the
substitutions that&#39;s a link in the cycle)</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea is to allow a new value for a field to be based on the
older value:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">path</span> : <span class="hljs-string">"a:b:c"</span>
path : <span class="hljs-variable">${path}</span><span class="hljs-string">":d"</span>
</code></pre><p>A <em>self-referential field</em> is one which:</p>
<ul>
<li>has a substitution, or value concatenation containing a
substitution, as its value</li>
<li>where this field value refers to the field being defined,
either directly or by referring to one or more other
substitutions which eventually point back to the field being
defined</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of self-referential fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a : ${a}</code></li>
<li><code>a : ${a}bc</code></li>
<li><code>path : ${path} [ /usr/bin ]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an object or array with a substitution inside it is
<em>not</em> considered self-referential for this purpose. The
self-referential rules do <em>not</em> apply to:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>a : { b : ${a} }</code></li>
<li><code>a : [${a}]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These cases are unbreakable cycles that generate an error. (If
&quot;looking backward&quot; were allowed for these, something like
<code>a={ x : 42, y : ${a.x} }</code> would look backward for a
nonexistent <code>a</code> while resolving <code>${a.x}</code>.)</p>
<p>A possible implementation is:</p>
<ul>
<li>substitutions are resolved by looking up paths in a document.
Cycles only arise when the lookup document is an ancestor
node of the substitution node.</li>
<li>while resolving a potentially self-referential field (any
substitution or value concatenation that contains a
substitution), remove that field and all fields which override
it from the lookup document.</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest form of this implementation will report a circular
reference as missing; in <code>a : ${a}</code> you would remove <code>a : ${a}</code>
while resolving <code>${a}</code>, leaving an empty document to look up
<code>${a}</code> in. You can give a more helpful error message if, rather
than simply removing the field, you leave a marker value
describing the cycle. Then generate an error if you return to that
marker value during resolution.</p>
<p>Cycles should be treated the same as a missing value when
resolving an optional substitution (i.e. the <code>${?foo}</code> syntax).
If <code>${?foo}</code> refers to itself then it&#39;s as if it referred to a
nonexistent value.</p>
<h4 id="the-field-separator">The <code>+=</code> field separator</h4>
<p>Fields may have <code>+=</code> as a separator rather than <code>:</code> or <code>=</code>. A
field with <code>+=</code> transforms into a self-referential array
concatenation, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-attribute">a +</span>=<span class="hljs-string"> b</span>
</code></pre><p>becomes:</p>
<pre><code>a = <span class="hljs-variable">${</span><span class="hljs-string">?a</span>} [b]
</code></pre><p><code>+=</code> appends an element to a previous array. If the previous value
was not an array, an error will result just as it would in the
long form <code>a = ${?a} [b]</code>. Note that the previous value is
optional (<code>${?a}</code> not <code>${a}</code>), which allows <code>a += b</code> to be the
first mention of <code>a</code> in the file (it is not necessary to have <code>a =
[]</code> first).</p>
<p>Note: Akka 2.0 (and thus Play 2.0) contains an embedded
implementation of the config lib which does not support <code>+=</code>.</p>
<h4 id="examples-of-self-referential-substitutions">Examples of Self-Referential Substitutions</h4>
<p>In isolation (with no merges involved), a self-referential field
is an error because the substitution cannot be resolved:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">foo</span> : <span class="hljs-variable">${foo}</span> // an <span class="hljs-built_in">error</span>
</code></pre><p>When <code>foo : ${foo}</code> is merged with an earlier value for <code>foo</code>,
however, the substitution can be resolved to that earlier value.
When merging two objects, the self-reference in the overriding
field refers to the overridden field. Say you have:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">foo</span> : <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">a </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> </span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>and then:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">foo</span> : <span class="hljs-variable">${foo}</span>
</code></pre><p>Then <code>${foo}</code> resolves to <code>{ a : 1 }</code>, the value of the overridden
field.</p>
<p>It would be an error if these two fields were reversed, so first:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">foo</span> : <span class="hljs-variable">${foo}</span>
</code></pre><p>and then second:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">foo</span> : <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">a </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> </span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>Here the <code>${foo}</code> self-reference comes before <code>foo</code> has a value,
so it is undefined, exactly as if the substitution referenced a
path not found in the document.</p>
<p>Because <code>foo : ${foo}</code> conceptually looks to previous definitions
of <code>foo</code> for a value, the error should be treated as &quot;undefined&quot;
rather than &quot;intractable cycle&quot;; as a result, the optional
substitution syntax <code>${?foo}</code> does not create a cycle:</p>
<pre><code>foo : ${?foo} <span class="hljs-comment">// this field just disappears silently</span>
</code></pre><p>If a substitution is hidden by a value that could not be merged
with it (by a non-object value) then it is never evaluated and no
error will be reported. So for example:</p>
<pre><code>foo <span class="hljs-symbol">:</span> <span class="hljs-variable">${</span>does-<span class="hljs-keyword">not</span>-exist}
foo <span class="hljs-symbol">:</span> <span class="hljs-number">42</span>
</code></pre><p>In this case, no matter what <code>${does-not-exist}</code> resolves to, we
know <code>foo</code> is <code>42</code>, so <code>${does-not-exist}</code> is never evaluated and
there is no error. The same is true for cycles like <code>foo : ${foo},
foo : 42</code>, where the initial self-reference must simply be ignored.</p>
<p>A self-reference resolves to the value &quot;below&quot; even if it&#39;s part
of a path expression. So for example:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">foo</span> : { <span class="hljs-title">a</span> : { <span class="hljs-title">c</span> : <span class="hljs-number">1</span> } }
foo : <span class="hljs-variable">${foo.a}</span>
foo : { <span class="hljs-title">a</span> : <span class="hljs-number">2</span> }
</code></pre><p>Here, <code>${foo.a}</code> would refer to <code>{ c : 1 }</code> rather than <code>2</code> and so
the final merge would be <code>{ a : 2, c : 1 }</code>.</p>
<p>Recall that for a field to be self-referential, it must have a
substitution or value concatenation as its value. If a field has
an object or array value, for example, then it is not
self-referential even if there is a reference to the field itself
inside that object or array.</p>
<p>Implementations must be careful to allow objects to refer to paths
within themselves, for example:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">bar</span> : <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">foo </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">42</span>,
        baz : ${bar.foo</span></span></span>}
      }
</code></pre><p>Here, if an implementation resolved all substitutions in <code>bar</code> as
part of resolving the substitution <code>${bar.foo}</code>, there would be a
cycle. The implementation must only resolve the <code>foo</code> field in
<code>bar</code>, rather than recursing the entire <code>bar</code> object.</p>
<p>Because there is no inherent cycle here, the substitution must
&quot;look forward&quot; (including looking at the field currently being
defined). To make this clearer, <code>bar.baz</code> would be <code>43</code> in:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-tag">bar</span> : <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">foo </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">42</span>,
        baz : ${bar.foo</span></span></span>}
      }
<span class="hljs-tag">bar</span> : <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">foo </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">43</span> </span></span></span>}
</code></pre><p>Mutually-referring objects should also work, and are not
self-referential (so they look forward):</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">// bar.a should end up as 4</span>
bar : { a : ${foo.d}, b : <span class="hljs-number">1</span> }
bar.b = <span class="hljs-number">3</span>
<span class="hljs-comment">// foo.c should end up as 3</span>
foo : { <span class="hljs-built_in">c</span> : ${bar.b}, d : <span class="hljs-number">2</span> }
foo.d = <span class="hljs-number">4</span>
</code></pre><p>Another tricky case is an optional self-reference in a value
concatenation, in this example <code>a</code> should be <code>foo</code> not <code>foofoo</code>
because the self reference has to &quot;look back&quot; to an undefined <code>a</code>:</p>
<pre><code>a = <span class="hljs-variable">${</span><span class="hljs-string">?a</span>}foo
</code></pre><p>In general, in resolving a substitution the implementation must:</p>
<ul>
<li>lazy-evaluate the substitution target so there&#39;s no
&quot;circularity by side effect&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;look forward&quot; and use the final value for the path
specified in the substitution</li>
<li>if a cycle results, the implementation must &quot;look back&quot;
in the merge stack to try to resolve the cycle</li>
<li>if neither lazy evaluation nor &quot;looking only backward&quot; resolves
a cycle, the substitution is missing which is an error unless
the <code>${?foo}</code> optional-substitution syntax was used.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, this is not possible to resolve:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">bar</span> : <span class="hljs-variable">${foo}</span>
foo : <span class="hljs-variable">${bar}</span>
</code></pre><p>A multi-step loop like this should also be detected as invalid:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-title">a</span> : <span class="hljs-variable">${b}</span>
b : <span class="hljs-variable">${c}</span>
c : <span class="hljs-variable">${a}</span>
</code></pre><p>Some cases have undefined behavior because the behavior depends on
the order in which two fields are resolved, and that order is not
defined. For example:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-operator">a</span> : <span class="hljs-number">1</span>
b : <span class="hljs-number">2</span>
<span class="hljs-operator">a</span> : ${b}
b : ${<span class="hljs-operator">a</span>}
</code></pre><p>Implementations are allowed to handle this by setting both <code>a</code> and
<code>b</code> to 1, setting both to <code>2</code>, or generating an error. Ideally
this situation would generate an error, but that may be difficult
to implement. Making the behavior defined would require always
working with ordered maps rather than unordered maps, which is too
constraining. Implementations only have to track order for
duplicate instances of the same field (i.e. merges).</p>
<h3 id="includes">Includes</h3>
<h4 id="include-syntax">Include syntax</h4>
<p>An <em>include statement</em> consists of the unquoted string <code>include</code>
followed by whitespace and then either:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single <em>quoted</em> string which is interpreted heuristically as
URL, filename, or classpath resource.</li>
<li><code>url()</code>, <code>file()</code>, or <code>classpath()</code> surrounding a quoted string
which is then interpreted as a URL, file, or classpath. The
string must be quoted, unlike in CSS.</li>
</ul>
<p>An include statement can appear in place of an object field.</p>
<p>If the unquoted string <code>include</code> appears at the start of a path
expression where an object key would be expected, then it is not
interpreted as a path expression or a key.</p>
<p>Instead, the next value must be a <em>quoted</em> string or a quoted
string surrounded by <code>url()</code>, <code>file()</code>, or <code>classpath()</code>.
This value is the <em>resource name</em>.</p>
<p>Together, the unquoted <code>include</code> and the resource name substitute
for an object field syntactically, and are separated from the
following object fields or includes by the usual comma (and as
usual the comma may be omitted if there&#39;s a newline).</p>
<p>If an unquoted <code>include</code> at the start of a key is followed by
anything other than a single quoted string or the
<code>url(&quot;&quot;)</code>/<code>file(&quot;&quot;)/</code>classpath(&quot;&quot;)` syntax, it is invalid and an
error should be generated.</p>
<p>There can be any amount of whitespace, including newlines, between
the unquoted <code>include</code> and the resource name. For <code>url()</code> etc.,
whitespace is allowed inside the parentheses <code>()</code> (outside of the
quotes).</p>
<p>Value concatenation is NOT performed on the &quot;argument&quot; to
<code>include</code> or <code>url()</code> etc. The argument must be a single quoted
string. No substitutions are allowed, and the argument may not be
an unquoted string or any other kind of value.</p>
<p>Unquoted <code>include</code> has no special meaning if it is not the start
of a key&#39;s path expression.</p>

<h4 id="include-semantics-merging">Include semantics: merging</h4>
<p>An <em>including file</em> contains the include statement and an
<em>included file</em> is the one specified in the include statement.
(They need not be regular files on a filesystem, but assume they
are for the moment.)</p>
<p>An included file must contain an object, not an array. This is
significant because both JSON and HOCON allow arrays as root
values in a document.</p>
<p>If an included file contains an array as the root value, it is
invalid and an error should be generated.</p>
<p>The included file should be parsed, producing a root object. The
keys from the root object are conceptually substituted for the
include statement in the including file.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a key in the included object occurred prior to the include
statement in the including object, the included key&#39;s value
overrides or merges with the earlier value, exactly as with
duplicate keys found in a single file.</li>
<li>If the including file repeats a key from an earlier-included
object, the including file&#39;s value would override or merge
with the one from the included file.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="include-semantics-substitution">Include semantics: substitution</h4>
<p>Substitutions in included files are looked up at two different
paths; first, relative to the root of the included file; second,
relative to the root of the including configuration.</p>
<p>Recall that substitution happens as a final step, <em>after</em>
parsing. It should be done for the entire app&#39;s configuration, not
for single files in isolation.</p>
<p>Therefore, if an included file contains substitutions, they must
be &quot;fixed up&quot; to be relative to the app&#39;s configuration root.</p>
<p>Say for example that the root configuration is this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">a </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> { include <span class="hljs-string">"foo.conf"</span> </span></span></span>} }
</code></pre><p>And &quot;foo.conf&quot; might look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">x </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">10</span>, y : ${x</span></span></span>} }
</code></pre><p>If you parsed &quot;foo.conf&quot; in isolation, then <code>${x}</code> would evaluate
to 10, the value at the path <code>x</code>. If you include &quot;foo.conf&quot; in an
object at key <code>a</code>, however, then it must be fixed up to be
<code>${a.x}</code> rather than <code>${x}</code>.</p>
<p>Say that the root configuration redefines <code>a.x</code>, like this:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-rules">{
    <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">a </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> { include <span class="hljs-string">"foo.conf"</span> </span></span></span>}
    <span class="hljs-tag">a</span> : <span class="hljs-rules">{ <span class="hljs-rule"><span class="hljs-attribute">x </span>:<span class="hljs-value"> <span class="hljs-number">42</span> </span></span></span>}
}
</code></pre><p>Then the <code>${x}</code> in &quot;foo.conf&quot;, which has been fixed up to
<code>${a.x}</code>, would evaluate to <code>42</code> rather than to <code>10</code>.
Substitution happens <em>after</em> parsing the whole configuration.</p>
<p>However, there are plenty of cases where the included file might
intend to refer to the application&#39;s root config. For example, to
get a value from a system property or from the reference
configuration. So it&#39;s not enough to only look up the &quot;fixed up&quot;
path, it&#39;s necessary to look up the original path as well.</p>
<h4 id="include-semantics-missing-files">Include semantics: missing files</h4>
<p>If an included file does not exist, the include statement should
be silently ignored (as if the included file contained only an
empty object).</p>
<p>Other IO errors probably should not be ignored but implementations
will have to make a judgment which IO errors reflect an ignorable
missing file, and which reflect a problem to bring to the user&#39;s
attention.</p>
<h4 id="include-semantics-file-formats-and-extensions">Include semantics: file formats and extensions</h4>
<p>Implementations may support including files in other formats.
Those formats must be compatible with the JSON type system, or
have some documented mapping to JSON&#39;s type system.</p>
<p>If an implementation supports multiple formats, then the extension
may be omitted from the name of included files:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo"</span>
</code></pre><p>If a filename has no extension, the implementation should treat it
as a basename and try loading the file with all known extensions.</p>
<p>If the file exists with multiple extensions, they should <em>all</em> be
loaded and merged together.</p>
<p>Files in HOCON format should be parsed last. Files in JSON format
should be parsed next-to-last.</p>
<p>In short, <code>include &quot;foo&quot;</code> might be equivalent to:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo.properties"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo.json"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">include</span> <span class="hljs-string">"foo.conf"</span>
</code></pre><p>This same extension-based behavior is applied to classpath
resources and files.</p>
<p>For URLs, a basename without extension is not allowed; only the
exact URL specified is used. The format will be chosen based on
the Content-Type if available, or by the extension of the path
component of the URL if no Content-Type is set. This is true even
for file: URLs.</p>
<h4 id="include-semantics-locating-resources">Include semantics: locating resources</h4>
<p>A quoted string not surrounded by <code>url()</code>, <code>file()</code>, <code>classpath()</code>
must be interpreted heuristically. The heuristic is to treat the
quoted string as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a URL, if the quoted string is a valid URL with a known
protocol.</li>
<li>otherwise, a file or other resource &quot;adjacent to&quot; the one being
parsed and of the same type as the one being parsed. The meaning
of &quot;adjacent to&quot;, and the string itself, has to be specified
separately for each kind of resource.</li>
<li>On the Java Virtual Machine, if an include statement does not
identify a valid URL or an existing resource &quot;adjacent to&quot; the
including resource, implementations may wish to fall back to a
classpath resource.  This allows configurations found in files
or URLs to access classpath resources in a natural way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementations may vary in the kinds of resources they can
include.</p>
<p>For resources located on the Java classpath:</p>
<ul>
<li>included resources are looked up by calling <code>getResource()</code> on
the same class loader used to look up the including resource.</li>
<li>if the included resource name is absolute (starts with &#39;/&#39;)
then it should be passed to <code>getResource()</code> with the &#39;/&#39;
removed.</li>
<li>if the included resource name does not start with &#39;/&#39; then it
should have the &quot;directory&quot; of the including resource
prepended to it, before passing it to <code>getResource()</code>.  If the
including resource is not absolute (no &#39;/&#39;) and has no &quot;parent
directory&quot; (is just a single path element), then the included
relative resource name should be left as-is.</li>
<li>it would be wrong to use <code>getResource()</code> to get a URL and then
locate the included name relative to that URL, because a class
loader is not required to have a one-to-one mapping between
paths in its URLs and the paths it handles in <code>getResource()</code>.
In other words, the &quot;adjacent to&quot; computation should be done
on the resource name not on the resource&#39;s URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>For plain files on the filesystem:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the included file is an absolute path then it should be kept
absolute and loaded as such.</li>
<li>if the included file is a relative path, then it should be
located relative to the directory containing the including
file.  The current working directory of the process parsing a
file must NOT be used when interpreting included paths.</li>
<li>if the file is not found, fall back to the classpath resource.
The classpath resource should not have any package name added
in front, it should be relative to the &quot;root&quot;; which means any
leading &quot;/&quot; should just be removed (absolute is the same as
relative since it&#39;s root-relative). The &quot;/&quot; is handled for
consistency with including resources from inside other
classpath resources, where the resource name may not be
root-relative and &quot;/&quot; allows specifying relative to root.</li>
</ul>
<p>URLs:</p>
<ul>
<li>for files loaded from a URL, &quot;adjacent to&quot; should be based
on parsing the URL&#39;s path component, replacing the last
path element with the included name.</li>
<li>file: URLs should behave in exactly the same way as a plain
filename</li>
</ul>
<p>Implementations need not support files, Java resources, or URLs;
and they need not support particular URL protocols. However, if
they do support them they should do so as described above.</p>
<h3 id="conversion-of-numerically-indexed-objects-to-arrays">Conversion of numerically-indexed objects to arrays</h3>
<p>In some file formats and contexts, such as Java properties files,
there isn&#39;t a good way to define arrays. To provide some mechanism
for this, implementations should support converting objects with
numeric keys into arrays. For example, this object:</p>
<pre><code>{ "<span class="hljs-attribute">0</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"a"</span></span>, "<span class="hljs-attribute">1</span>" : <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-string">"b"</span> </span>}
</code></pre><p>could be treated as:</p>
<pre><code>[ <span class="hljs-string">"a"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"b"</span> ]
</code></pre><p>This allows creating an array in a properties file like this:</p>
<pre><code>foo.<span class="hljs-number">0</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"a"</span>
foo.<span class="hljs-number">1</span> = <span class="hljs-string">"b"</span>
</code></pre><p>The details:</p>
<ul>
<li>the conversion should be done lazily when required to avoid
a type error, NOT eagerly anytime an object has numeric
keys.</li>
<li>the conversion should be done when you would do an automatic
type conversion (see the section &quot;Automatic type conversions&quot;
below).</li>
<li>the conversion should be done in a concatenation when a list
is expected and an object with numeric keys is found.</li>
<li>the conversion should not occur if the object is empty or
has no keys which parse as positive integers.</li>
<li>the conversion should ignore any keys which do not parse
as positive integers.</li>
<li>the conversion should sort by the integer value of each
key and then build the array; if the integer keys are &quot;0&quot; and
&quot;2&quot; then the resulting array would have indices &quot;0&quot; and &quot;1&quot;,
i.e. missing indices in the object are eliminated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mime-type">MIME Type</h2>
<p>Use &quot;application/hocon&quot; for Content-Type.</p>
<h2 id="api-recommendations">API Recommendations</h2>
<p>Implementations of HOCON ideally follow certain conventions and
work in a predictable way.</p>
<h3 id="automatic-type-conversions">Automatic type conversions</h3>
<p>If an application asks for a value with a particular type, the
implementation should attempt to convert types as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>number to string: convert the number into a string
representation that would be a valid number in JSON.</li>
<li>boolean to string: should become the string &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;</li>
<li>string to number: parse the number with the JSON rules</li>
<li>string to boolean: the strings &quot;true&quot;, &quot;yes&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;false&quot;,
&quot;no&quot;, &quot;off&quot; should be converted to boolean values. It&#39;s
tempting to support a long list of other ways to write a
boolean, but for interoperability and keeping it simple, it&#39;s
recommended to stick to these six.</li>
<li>string to null: the string <code>&quot;null&quot;</code> should be converted to a
null value if the application specifically asks for a null
value, though there&#39;s probably no reason an app would do this.</li>
<li>numerically-indexed object to array: see the section
&quot;Conversion of numerically-indexed objects to arrays&quot; above</li>
</ul>
<p>The following type conversions should NOT be performed:</p>
<ul>
<li>null to anything: If the application asks for a specific type
and finds null instead, that should usually result in an error.</li>
<li>object to anything</li>
<li>array to anything</li>
<li>anything to object</li>
<li>anything to array, with the exception of numerically-indexed
object to array</li>
</ul>
<p>Converting objects and arrays to and from strings is tempting, but
in practical situations raises thorny issues of quoting and
double-escaping.</p>
<h3 id="units-format">Units format</h3>
<p>Implementations may wish to support interpreting a value with some
family of units, such as time units or memory size units: <code>10ms</code>
or <code>512K</code>. HOCON does not have an extensible type system and there
is no way to add a &quot;duration&quot; type. However, for example, if an
application asks for milliseconds, the implementation can try to
interpret a value as a milliseconds value.</p>
<p>If an API supports this, for each family of units it should define
a default unit in the family. For example, the family of duration
units might default to milliseconds (see below for details on
durations). The implementation should then interpret values as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>if the value is a number, it is taken to be a number in
the default unit.</li>
<li><p>if the value is a string, it is taken to be this sequence:</p>
<ul>
<li>optional whitespace</li>
<li>a number</li>
<li>optional whitespace</li>
<li>an optional unit name consisting only of letters (letters
are the Unicode <code>L*</code> categories, Java <code>isLetter()</code>)</li>
<li>optional whitespace</li>
</ul>
<p>If a string value has no unit name, then it should be
interpreted with the default unit, as if it were a number. If a
string value has a unit name, that name of course specifies the
value&#39;s interpretation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="duration-format">Duration format</h3>
<p>Implementations may wish to support a <code>getMilliseconds()</code> (and
similar for other time units).</p>
<p>This can use the general &quot;units format&quot; described above; bare
numbers are taken to be in milliseconds already, while strings are
parsed as a number plus an optional unit string.</p>
<p>The supported unit strings for duration are case sensitive and
must be lowercase. Exactly these strings are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>ns</code>, <code>nanosecond</code>, <code>nanoseconds</code></li>
<li><code>us</code>, <code>microsecond</code>, <code>microseconds</code></li>
<li><code>ms</code>, <code>millisecond</code>, <code>milliseconds</code></li>
<li><code>s</code>, <code>second</code>, <code>seconds</code></li>
<li><code>m</code>, <code>minute</code>, <code>minutes</code></li>
<li><code>h</code>, <code>hour</code>, <code>hours</code></li>
<li><code>d</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>days</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="size-in-bytes-format">Size in bytes format</h3>
<p>Implementations may wish to support a <code>getBytes()</code> returning a
size in bytes.</p>
<p>This can use the general &quot;units format&quot; described above; bare
numbers are taken to be in bytes already, while strings are
parsed as a number plus an optional unit string.</p>
<p>The one-letter unit strings may be uppercase (note: duration units
are always lowercase, so this convention is specific to size
units).</p>
<p>There is an unfortunate nightmare with size-in-bytes units, that
they may be in powers or two or powers of ten. The approach
defined by standards bodies appears to differ from common usage,
such that following the standard leads to people being confused.
Worse, common usage varies based on whether people are talking
about RAM or disk sizes, and various existing operating systems
and apps do all kinds of different things.  See
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#Deviation_between_powers_of_1024_and_powers_of_1000">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#Deviation_between_powers_of_1024_and_powers_of_1000</a>
for examples. It appears impossible to sort this out without
causing confusion for someone sometime.</p>
<p>For single bytes, exactly these strings are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>B</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>byte</code>, <code>bytes</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For powers of ten, exactly these strings are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kB</code>, <code>kilobyte</code>, <code>kilobytes</code></li>
<li><code>MB</code>, <code>megabyte</code>, <code>megabytes</code></li>
<li><code>GB</code>, <code>gigabyte</code>, <code>gigabytes</code></li>
<li><code>TB</code>, <code>terabyte</code>, <code>terabytes</code></li>
<li><code>PB</code>, <code>petabyte</code>, <code>petabytes</code></li>
<li><code>EB</code>, <code>exabyte</code>, <code>exabytes</code></li>
<li><code>ZB</code>, <code>zettabyte</code>, <code>zettabytes</code></li>
<li><code>YB</code>, <code>yottabyte</code>, <code>yottabytes</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For powers of two, exactly these strings are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>K</code>, <code>k</code>, <code>Ki</code>, <code>KiB</code>, <code>kibibyte</code>, <code>kibibytes</code></li>
<li><code>M</code>, <code>m</code>, <code>Mi</code>, <code>MiB</code>, <code>mebibyte</code>, <code>mebibytes</code></li>
<li><code>G</code>, <code>g</code>, <code>Gi</code>, <code>GiB</code>, <code>gibibyte</code>, <code>gibibytes</code></li>
<li><code>T</code>, <code>t</code>, <code>Ti</code>, <code>TiB</code>, <code>tebibyte</code>, <code>tebibytes</code></li>
<li><code>P</code>, <code>p</code>, <code>Pi</code>, <code>PiB</code>, <code>pebibyte</code>, <code>pebibytes</code></li>
<li><code>E</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>Ei</code>, <code>EiB</code>, <code>exbibyte</code>, <code>exbibytes</code></li>
<li><code>Z</code>, <code>z</code>, <code>Zi</code>, <code>ZiB</code>, <code>zebibyte</code>, <code>zebibytes</code></li>
<li><code>Y</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>Yi</code>, <code>YiB</code>, <code>yobibyte</code>, <code>yobibytes</code></li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s very unclear which units the single-character abbreviations
(&quot;128K&quot;) should go with; some precedents such as <code>java -Xmx 2G</code>
and the GNU tools such as <code>ls</code> map these to powers of two, so this
spec copies that. You can certainly find examples of mapping these
to powers of ten, though. If you don&#39;t like ambiguity, don&#39;t use
the single-letter abbreviations.</p>
<h3 id="config-object-merging-and-file-merging">Config object merging and file merging</h3>
<p>It may be useful to offer a method to merge two objects. If such a
method is provided, it should work as if the two objects were
duplicate values for the same key in the same file. (See the
section earlier on duplicate key handling.)</p>
<p>As with duplicate keys, an intermediate non-object value &quot;hides&quot;
earlier object values. So say you merge three objects in this
order:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{ a : { x : 1 } }</code>  (first priority)</li>
<li><code>{ a : 42 }</code> (fallback)</li>
<li><code>{ a : { y : 2 } }</code> (another fallback)</li>
</ul>
<p>The result would be <code>{ a : { x : 1 } }</code>. The two objects are not
merged because they are not &quot;adjacent&quot;; the merging is done in
pairs, and when <code>42</code> is paired with <code>{ y : 2 }</code>, <code>42</code> simply wins
and loses all information about what it overrode.</p>
<p>But if you re-ordered like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{ a : { x : 1 } }</code>  (first priority)</li>
<li><code>{ a : { y : 2 } }</code> (fallback)</li>
<li><code>{ a : 42 }</code> (another fallback)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the result would be <code>{ a : { x : 1, y : 2 } }</code> because the two
objects are adjacent.</p>
<p>This rule for merging objects loaded from different files is
<em>exactly</em> the same behavior as for merging duplicate fields in the
same file. All merging works the same way.</p>
<p>Needless to say, normally it&#39;s well-defined whether a config
setting is supposed to be a number or an object. This kind of
weird pathology where the two are mixed should not be happening.</p>
<p>The one place where it matters, though, is that it allows you to
&quot;clear&quot; an object and start over by setting it to null and then
setting it back to a new object. So this behavior gives people a
way to get rid of default fallback values they don&#39;t want.</p>
<h3 id="java-properties-mapping">Java properties mapping</h3>
<p>It may be useful to merge Java properties data with data loaded
from JSON or HOCON. See the Java properties spec here:
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load%28java.io.Reader%29">http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load%28java.io.Reader%29</a></p>
<p>Java properties parse as a one-level map from string keys to
string values.</p>
<p>To convert to HOCON, first split each key on the <code>.</code> character,
keeping any empty strings (including leading and trailing empty
strings). Note that this is <em>very different</em> from parsing a path
expression.</p>
<p>The key split on <code>.</code> is a series of path elements. So the
properties key with just <code>.</code> is a path with two elements, both of
them an empty string. <code>a.</code> is a path with two elements, <code>a</code> and
empty string.  (Java&#39;s <code>String.split()</code> does NOT do what you want
for this.)</p>
<p>It is impossible to represent a key with a <code>.</code> in it in a
properties file.  If a JSON/HOCON key has a <code>.</code> in it, which is
possible if the key is quoted, then there is no way to refer to it
as a Java property. It is not recommended to name HOCON keys with
a <code>.</code> in them, since it would be confusing at best in any case.</p>
<p>Once you have a path for each value, construct a tree of
JSON-style objects with the string value of each property located
at that value&#39;s path.</p>
<p>Values from properties files are <em>always</em> strings, even if they
could be parsed as some other type. Implementations should do type
conversion if an app asks for an integer, as described in an
earlier section.</p>
<p>When Java loads a properties file, unfortunately it does not
preserve the order of the file. As a result, there is an
intractable case where a single key needs to refer to both a
parent object and a string value. For example, say the Java
properties file has:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-variable">a=</span>hello
a.<span class="hljs-variable">b=</span>world
</code></pre><p>In this case, <code>a</code> needs to be both an object and a string value.
The <em>object</em> must always win in this case... the &quot;object wins&quot;
rule throws out at most one value (the string) while &quot;string wins&quot;
would throw out all values in the object. Unfortunately, when
properties files are mapped to the JSON structure, there is no way
to access these strings that conflict with objects.</p>
<p>The usual rule in HOCON would be that the later assignment in the
file wins, rather than &quot;object wins&quot;; but implementing that for
Java properties would require implementing a custom Java
properties parser, which is surely not worth it and wouldn&#39;t help
with system properties anyway.</p>
<h3 id="conventional-configuration-files-for-jvm-apps">Conventional configuration files for JVM apps</h3>
<p>By convention, JVM apps have two parts to their configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>reference</em> config is made up of all resources named
<code>reference.conf</code> on the classpath, merged in the order they
are returned by <code>ClassLoader.getResources()</code>; also, system
property overrides are applied.</li>
<li>the <em>application</em> config can be loaded from anywhere an
application likes, but by default if the application doesn&#39;t
provide a config it would be loaded from files
<code>application.{conf,json,properties}</code> on the classpath and
then system property overrides are applied.</li>
<li>the reference config may be different for different class
loaders, since each jar may provide a <code>reference.conf</code>
to go with the code in that jar.</li>
<li>a single JVM may have multiple application configs if
it has multiple modules or contexts of some kind.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reference config for a given class loader should be merged and
resolved first, and may be shared among all application configs in
that class loader. Substitutions in the reference config are not
affected by any application configs, because the reference config
should be resolved by itself.</p>
<p>The application config should then be loaded, have the reference
config added as a fallback, and have substitutions resolved. This
means the application config can refer to the reference config in
its substitutions.</p>
<h3 id="conventional-override-by-system-properties">Conventional override by system properties</h3>
<p>For an application&#39;s config, Java system properties <em>override</em>
settings found in the configuration file. This supports specifying
config options on the command line.</p>
<h3 id="substitution-fallback-to-environment-variables">Substitution fallback to environment variables</h3>
<p>Recall that if a substitution is not present (not even set to
<code>null</code>) within a configuration tree, implementations may search
for it from external sources. One such source could be environment
variables.</p>
<p>It&#39;s recommended that HOCON keys always use lowercase, because
environment variables generally are capitalized. This avoids
naming collisions between environment variables and configuration
properties. (While on Windows getenv() is generally not
case-sensitive, the lookup will be case sensitive all the way
until the env variable fallback lookup is reached.)</p>
<p>An application can explicitly block looking up a substitution in
the environment by setting a value in the configuration, with the
same name as the environment variable. You could set <code>HOME : null</code>
in your root object to avoid expanding <code>${HOME}</code> from the
environment, for example.</p>
<p>Environment variables are interpreted as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>env variables set to the empty string are kept as such (set to
empty string, rather than undefined)</li>
<li>System.getenv throws SecurityException: treated as not present</li>
<li>encoding is handled by Java (System.getenv already returns
a Unicode string)</li>
<li>environment variables always become a string value, though
if an app asks for another type automatic type conversion
would kick in</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hyphen-separated-vs-camelcase">hyphen-separated vs. camelCase</h3>
<p>Config keys are encouraged to be <code>hyphen-separated</code> rather than
<code>camelCase</code>.</p>
